    <h2>About selling in Hawaii</h2>
    <p><strong>At a glance:</strong> Capital gains tax ~ 11%; Transfer/Conveyance taxes: $0.10-$1.25 per $100; Typical seller closing costs: 1-3%. Median home price around $850,000 with average days on market near 45. Major markets include Honolulu, Pearl City, Hilo, Kailua.</p>
    <p>Hawaii's 11% top capital gains tax rate is second only to California, significantly impacting proceeds. However, limited island land supply has driven massive appreciation, especially on Oahu and Maui.</p>
    <p><em>Market insight:</em> Oahu remains the primary market with Honolulu commanding premiums. Neighbor islands offer varying dynamics from luxury resorts to local communities.</p>
    <p><em>Tax note:</em> Hawaii's progressive conveyance tax increases with price, reaching 1.25% for properties over $10 million.</p>
