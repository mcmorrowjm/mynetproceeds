    <h2>About selling in Florida</h2>
    <p><strong>At a glance:</strong> Capital gains tax ~ 0%; Transfer/Conveyance taxes: $0.70 per $100; Typical seller closing costs: 1-2%. Median home price around $400,000 with average days on market near 35. Major markets include Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville.</p>
    <p>Florida's zero state income tax means no state capital gains taxes on your home sale - a massive advantage that can save tens of thousands compared to high-tax states. This tax benefit, combined with strong demand from retirees and remote workers, makes Florida one of the best states for maximizing home sale proceeds.</p>
    <p><em>Market insight:</em> Miami continues seeing international investment, Tampa Bay booms with tech migration, and Orlando benefits from tourism recovery. The pandemic accelerated Florida's population growth.</p>
    <p><em>Tax note:</em> While there's no income tax, Florida charges documentary stamp taxes of $0.70 per $100 of sale price, plus additional stamps in Miami-Dade County.</p>
