    <h2>How Maryland Taxes Affect Your Net Proceeds</h2>
    <p>When you sell a home in Maryland, your net proceeds depend on several factors: sale price, agent commissions, closing costs, and taxes. Federal capital gains rules apply nationwide, but Maryland’s state tax proxy of 5.75% can further reduce your take-home. Our calculator uses this Maryland-specific proxy by default and lets you override it if you know your effective rate.</p>
    <p>Closing costs in Maryland commonly run around 2.0% of the sale price, which may include title insurance, escrow fees, recording charges, and transfer taxes. Commission is fully editable—many sellers negotiate between 4% and 6% total.</p>
    <h3>Typical Example</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sale price: $500,000</li>
      <li>Commission (5%): $25,000</li>
      <li>Other closing costs (2.0%): $10,000</li>
      <li>State tax proxy on taxable gain: 5.75%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use the main calculator to see a line-by-line breakdown including estimated federal capital gains, state tax proxy, and depreciation recapture for rentals.</p>
