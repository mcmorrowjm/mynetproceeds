    <p>Alaska offers one of the most tax-friendly environments for home sellers with no state income tax or capital gains tax. Your profits from selling Alaska real estate are only subject to federal taxes.</p>
    <p><em>Market insight:</em> The Alaska market is unique with seasonal fluctuations and remote location challenges. Anchorage dominates with 40% of the state's population.</p>
    <p><em>Tax note:</em> No state taxes mean Alaska sellers keep thousands more than sellers in high-tax states like California or New York.</p>
